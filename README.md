# Radio

Kodi add-on to listen to **radio streams**, with a localized interface.

It is **inspired by the [radio.de](https://www.radio.de) service** and relies on its
public API `prod.radio-api.net`. The interface uses Kodi's standard localization system
(gettext / `.po` files) and offers a "cinema" view during playback.

## Installation

**Recommended — TheWorms repository** (automatic updates).

Download the repository by clicking **[HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWorms/kodi-repo/main/zips/repository.theworms/repository.theworms.zip)**, then in Kodi:

1. **Add-ons** → **Install from zip file** → select the downloaded zip
   *(if Kodi blocks it, enable **Unknown sources** under Settings → Add-ons)*
2. **Install from repository** → **TheWorms Repository** → pick the add-on
3. Updates will then be automatic

**Manual install (alternative):** download the add-on zip from the [Releases](../../releases) page, then **Add-ons** → **Install from zip file**.
